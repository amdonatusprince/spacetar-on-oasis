## What's next for Spacetar
Spacetar represents more than a decentralized application; it's a movement. In the future, we envision further enhancing the platform:

* **Expanded Features:** Our smart contract still has a lot of features that we'll continuously refine and expand on based on user feedback and evolving needs, ensuring it remains a cutting-edge and responsive platform. Also, we would be building out an admin section of the dApp so as to moderate things as the community grows.

* **Decentralized Exchange**: We would be working to integrate DEX into spacetar so that users can be able to swap their reward tokens, stake their tokens, or gift reward tokens to other community members.

* **Research and Innovation:** Currently the '@oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime'; only supports ethers so we would need to integrate support for views as we scale Spacetar.
  
* **AI Chatbot:** We are also working on leveraging OpenAI GPT-4 to integrate an AI chatbot assistance that will help the users to navigate through the dApp as we expand out features.

* **Annoymous Transfers:** We are also working on integrating stealth address to users can receive crypto without revealing their wallet address which is tehir identity on the blockchain

This feature is heavily inspired by [Vitalik's article on stealth addresses](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html)
